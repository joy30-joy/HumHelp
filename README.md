# HumHelp

HumHelp is a simple platform I built where people can either ask for help or offer help to others. It has a rating system so that users can mark if someone was helpful or not, which updates their score. There's also a leaderboard to show the top donors.

## Key Features

- Login/signup for two types of users â€“ Needers and Donors
- Donors can accept or reject help requests
- After help is given, Needers can rate it as "Fraud" or "Not Fraud"
- Points are updated based on ratings (fraud: -5, not fraud: +10)
- A leaderboard shows the top scoring donors

## Tech Stack

- React + Tailwind CSS (Frontend)
- Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Backend)
- JWT for authentication
